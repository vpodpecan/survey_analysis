## Survery analysis methodology and implementation

This Jupyter notebook serves as a sample implementation of the methodology for survery data analysis as described in these two papers:

> 1. Marinko, Jurij, Vladimir Kuzmanovski, Mark Ramsden, and Marko Debeljak. 2025. "Overcoming Barriers to the Adoption of Decision Support Systems in Integrated Pest Management in Some European Countries" Agronomy 15, no. 2: 426. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy15020426

> 2. Marinko, Jurij, Aneta Ivanovska, Martin Marzidovšek, Mark Ramsden, and Marko Debeljak. 2023. "Incentives and Barriers to Adoption of Decision Support Systems in Integrated Pest Management among Farmers and Farm Advisors in Europe." International Journal of Pest Management, August, 1–18. https://doi.org/10.1080/09670874.2023.2244912.

Please note that this is not an exact reimplementation. The code clearly implements the main parts using the Python programming language and a set of supporting libraries, and provides a solid base for further refinement.
